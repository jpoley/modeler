## Outline

This command creates feature specifications using a specialized PM (Product Manager) planner agent.

1. **PM Planner Agent**: Creates PRDs (Product Requirement Documents)
   - Analyzes product requirements from user input
   - Creates comprehensive PRDs following best practices
   - Manages task breakdown and prioritization
   - Integrates with /speckit.tasks for task management
   - Ensures specifications are clear, complete, and actionable

## Execution Flow

1. Parse user input to understand feature requirements

2. **Specification Creation**:
   - Dispatch PM Planner agent to analyze requirements
   - Generate Product Requirement Document (PRD)
   - Define user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies and constraints

3. **Task Management**:
   - Coordinate with /speckit.tasks for task breakdown
   - Ensure traceability between requirements and tasks
   - Define success criteria and metrics

4. **Output**:
   - Complete feature specification document
   - PRD with detailed requirements
   - Task breakdown and dependencies
   - Success criteria and acceptance tests

## Notes

- This command is a placeholder for future agent implementation
- Full PM Planner agent integration will be completed in a future task
- Manages interaction with /speckit.tasks workflow
